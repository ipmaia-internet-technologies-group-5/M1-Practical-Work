        <title>Destruction of Primary Rainforests Increased by 12% from 2019 to 2020</title>
        <description>
            <![CDATA[Description Test
            The tropics lost 12.2 million acres of tree cover by 2020, according to University of Maryland data 
            released today in Global Forest Watch. Of this total, 4.2 million hectares, an area the size of the Netherlands
            occurred in humid tropical primary forests, which are especially important for carbon storage and biodiversity. 
            Carbon emissions from this loss of primary forests (2.64 Gt CO2) are equivalent to annual emissions of 570 million 
            cars, more than double the number of vehicles circulating in the United States.

        <title>Venezuelan People and Forests Suffer as Gold Mining Advances</title>
        <description>
            <![CDATA[Description Test
            Mining in the Amazon is a pervasive threat to the world’s largest rainforest— and it’s on the rise. 
            Gold prices spiked last summer and have remained high. COVID-19-related stimulus packages supported 
            gold prices, and the economic threat posed by the pandemic turned investors towards the seemingly stable 
            investment in gold. Demand for the metal has accelerated. And where demand has grown, deforestation and 
            human rights abuses have followed. Venezuela’s rainforests and people have been hit particularly 
            hard by gold mining, where estimates indicate that between 80% and 90% is mined illegally.

        <title>Supplied with Tech, Indigenous Forest Monitors Curb Deforestation</title>
        <description>
            <![CDATA[Description Test
            Loreto, Peru — A forest monitor from the Indigenous community of Vista Hermosa checks her smartphone. 
            A satellite map showing the forest around her pops up. Her community’s territory is outlined and 
            pink pixels—deforestation alerts—are visible within the boundaries. She and her fellow forest monitors 
            react quickly, patrolling to the alert to confirm the deforestation. Finding the stumps and area cleared, 
            they snap some photos and record their observations, and return to their community to relay the information 
            and decide what to do next.

        <title>2022 Must Be a Turning Point for Forests. 2021 Data Shows Us Why</title>
        <description>
            <![CDATA[Description Test
            More than 12 million hectares of tree cover in the tropics was lost in 2020 alone, according to analysis 
            of University of Maryland data by WRI. Most alarmingly, that included 4.2 million hectares of previously 
            undisturbed primary tropical forests.This loss represents a crisis for climate stability and biodiversity 
            conservation, as well as a humanitarian disaster and lost economic opportunity. This analysis now covering 
            20 years of data shows all that’s been lost — as well as the interventions that work.

        <title>THE FORESTS ARE BURNING IN THE AMAZON AGAIN...</title>
        <description>
            <![CDATA[Description Test
            It’s the dry season in Brazil, and forest fires are spreading again. Though some can be caused 
            naturally by factors such as lightning strikes, most are actually started by farmers and loggers 
            clearing land for crops or grazing.
