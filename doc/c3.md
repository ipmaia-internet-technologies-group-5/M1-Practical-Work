## 3.1 Instalation

It is expected that the user who wants to install/run any application of this project has the minimum knowledge in working with command lines as well as using dialogs via command lines.

In order to run our project it is necessary to have some type of program that allows the website to run from a server so we decided to use wamp server.

According to [Hostinger Tutorials](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-wamp)

> WAMP is an acronym that stands for Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It’s a software stack which means installing WAMP installs Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your operating system (Windows in the case of WAMP). Even though you can install them separately, they are usually bundled up, and for a good reason too.
WAMP acts like a virtual server on your computer. It allows you to test all WordPress features without any consequences since it’s localized on your machine and is not connected to the web.

After downloading the project it was only necessary to move it to "www" folder and access the respective address by your browser (In our case: http://localhost/savetheforest/src).


## 3.2 Usage

Regarding access, as it is a system that does not use any kind of server-side technology, you don't need to do anything else, just access the website and explore.

## 3.3 Application/Product help


The website contains a header and a footer that contains all the main links of the website which allows the user to easily navigate through all the pages.

Regarding the structuring of the website, it is quite easy for the user to find the main information that follows the convention of all websites that would be a Main Page, an About Us and a Contact Us.
On the other pages we have a page reserved to show all our projects, we also have two pages reserved only for blogs that would be to find blogs as well as see the details of each news and finally the donation page that allows the user to help our cause by donating

## 3.4 Forms

Forms on a website are very important as they are one of the means by which the user interacts with the website and transmits information to other people. Based on this, the validations of each form are also very important because they ensure that the user is entering data that is in accordance with what the form asks for.

Therefore, a system of forms was designed where the user can easily know what it is about as well as from the validations to make the user put the correct information.

It is important to note that for the development of the forms it was decided to use two libraries, the [JQuery Form](https://malsup.com/jquery/form/) that is responsible for all the form logic and the [JQuery Validate](https://jqueryvalidation.org) which handles all the validations of the form in question in a very interactive way as we can see in the example below:

_Example of a form validation_

Based on this information described above, a form was created for the Contact Us page and for the Donation page.

There are a few more cases that are not using the validation system as it is not necessary as you can see in the footer for the user to subscribe to the newsletter, among others.
