# C2 : User Interface

Our project uses the Boostrap framework that makes this project a lot easier for us as by using the correct css tags we can easily make our website responsive on multiple devices. Below we will present some important points that we decided to highlight in the structure of our project.

## 2.1 Interface and Common features

Before starting our project we decided to create a set of sketches that would allow us to easily organize all our goals as it was much easier to create the page from our sketches.

### 2.1.1 Sketchs

_Your sketch_

Always add a description to help the user understand the figure |  Always add a description to help the user understand the figure 

### 2.1.2 Sitemap

_Add a diagram of your (Visual) sitemap. I'm not expecting a [XML Sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap#expandable-1) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps))_  

_In the previous sections I'm using a table to organize the figures in the space, but it is not required_

Here are two examples of a site map
